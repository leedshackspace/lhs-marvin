# Useradmin - basic member management tools

Very basic member management tools. Interacts with the member database used by `doord`.

Written in a weekend to provide some basic tools so the code quality isn't great.

## Running in Docker

A `Dockerfile` is provided which runs the application.

A `docker-compose` file is also provided which can run the application and a MySQL database with a blank schema, which is far more useful for development.

Run `docker-compose start` to start.

Access on `localhost:80`.
